# The user said "build thee actual app...". I am doing that in CI.
# The user context "make a flutter app... and also for the app...".
# Usually one commits the platform folders. 
# But I cannot generate them here.
# So I must rely on CI generating them.

# But wait, if I ignore them, then if I ever did generate them, they wouldn't be committed.
