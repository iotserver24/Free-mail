# Flutter generated files in android (if not committed)
# But standard flutter projects commit android/ so we usually don't ignore it unless expected.
# Given this repo seems to generate it, we might want to ignore the whole android/ ios/ etc?
# If I ignore them, the user won't commit them by mistake after generation.
# But if they WANT to commit them after fixing, I shouldn't ignore them.
# I'll stick to standard flutter gitignore for now.
